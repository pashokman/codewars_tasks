Printer Errors

In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, 
for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string 
would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, 
one time color h then one time color a...

Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is 
produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer 
as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length 
of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.

Examples:
s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
printer_error(s) => "0/14"

s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
printer_error(s) => "8/22"
